# Line-Jumper

Using this code you can navigate through lines in a file open as an ifstream object (jump to lines in a file).

I was working on some project in the past and felt the need for this functionality, but I never actually got to use it.
Due to some complications and uncertainty surrounding seekg() and tellg() functions, I think someone may find this code useful.
